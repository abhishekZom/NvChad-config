# Custom NvChad config

```sh
cp ./* ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom/
```


### init.lua not included as I left it empty

## NvChad (git sync)

> Note: only contents of custom directory are included since its gitignored in NvChad but other folders are not, meaning they are used to keep base configuration in sync. Don't touch other folders unless you want to freeze version.
